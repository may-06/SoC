# Project Progress So Far

#WEEK 1
-We were given resources to learn python-(basics,functions,classes)pandas and numpy.At the end of the week we were given some questions for practice.I maintained a jupyter note book file for learning the concepts(code).


#WEEK 2
-Some basic concepts of machine learning.

Following topics were covered in the resources:

           -Linear Regression theory
           
           -Logistic regerssion theory
           
           Implementation of the above topics using sklearn kit,pandas,numpy in python
           
-Practiced some basics related to this in spyder.     

-Neural Networks

-Image processing (computer vision)

-Deep Neural Networks

-Pytorch tutorial

-Neural style transfer
